# Traffic Prediction using ML and 4 way Traffic Light Controller

## Motivation:

### Problem statement:

- This project aims to use machine learning to predict optimal traffic light timings at four junctions. Inaccurate timings often lead to congestion due to rising populations and inefficient systems. By analyzing historical patterns, this project aims to create a model that optimizes timings dynamically, reducing delays and fuel wastage.


### Project importance:

- This project is important as it can transform urban transport. Traffic congestion causes economic losses and pollution. Creating an adaptable machine learning model for traffic light predictions can significantly improve traffic flow, leading to energy savings, lower emissions, and more sustainable cities.


### Dataset description:

- The dataset contains 48120 observations of the number of vehicles at four traffic junctions each hour, collected using sensors. It consists four columns and those are Datetime, Junction, Vehicles and ID.


### Project objectives:
1. To identify the most significant features for detecting the number of vehicles every hour.
2. Based on the model evaluation result, predict the number of vehicles at each junction on a given time on a given day.
3. Predict the time for traffic light at each junction and simulate it on traffic light controller unit.

#### Steps:

##### Clean data studying dataframe
1. Cleaned data by dropping null values. (Decided no further cleaning needed since the dataset appeared clean)
2. Studied the columns and what they represent as well as how many data are in each junction

##### EDA


##### Preprocessing/ Feature Selection


##### Predictions using ML models


##### Combining with hardware

## Results:


##### Model Evaluation results:


## Conclusion:
